# Exercise 1: Variables
# ---------------------
# Create a variable called name and assign it your first name.
# Print the variable to the screen.
name = "Poorna"
print(name)

# Exercise 2: Numbers
# ---------------------
# Create two variables, x and y, and assign them the values 5 and 10.
# Print their values.
x = 5
y = 10
print(x, y)

# Exercise 3: Arithmetic Operators
# ---------------------------------
# Using x and y from above, calculate and print:
#   - The sum
#   - The difference (x - y)
#   - The product
#   - The quotient
print(f"The sum of x and y is {x+y}")
print(f"The difference of x and y is {x-y}")
print(f"The product of x and y is {x*y}")
print(f"The quotient of x and y is {x/y}")


# Exercise 4: Strings
# ---------------------
# Create a variable greeting with the value "Hello".
# Create another variable person with your name.
# Print them together in one sentence (concatenate strings).
greeting = "Hello"
person = "Poorna"
print(greeting + " " + person)
#this line will print my name

# Exercise 5: Comments
# ---------------------
# Add a comment above a line of code explaining what it does.
# Example: # This line prints my name


# Exercise 6: Logical Operators
# ------------------------------
# Create two boolean variables: is_sunny = True, is_warm = False.
# Use logical operators to print:
#   - is_sunny AND is_warm
#   - is_sunny OR is_warm
#   - NOT is_sunny
is_sunny = True
is_warm = False


# Exercise 7: Combining Concepts
# -------------------------------
# Ask the user for their age using input().
# Convert it to an integer.
# Print whether they are old enough to vote (18 or older).


# Exercise 8: Challenge
# ---------------------
# Ask the user for two numbers.
# Print:
#   - Their sum
#   - Whether the first number is greater than the second
#   - Whether the numbers are equal


# Extra Challenge 1
# -----------------
# Ask the user for their name and age.
# Print a message: "Hello <name>, you will be <age+1> next year."


# Extra Challenge 2
# -----------------
# Ask the user for a number.
# Print whether the number is even or odd.


# Extra Challenge 3
# -----------------
# Create two string variables with any words.
# Print the total number of characters in both words combined.


# Extra Challenge 4
# -----------------
# Ask the user for their age and whether it is sunny (True/False).
# Print whether they are allowed to go outside if they are at least 12 years old AND it is sunny.


# Final Project: Mini Program
# ----------------------------
# Create a simple program that:
#   1. Asks the user for their name and greets them.
#   2. Asks for their age and tells them if they can vote.
#   3. Asks for two numbers and shows their sum, difference, product, and quotient.
#   4. Prints a farewell message that includes their name.
